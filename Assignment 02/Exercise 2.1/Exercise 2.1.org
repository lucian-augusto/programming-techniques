#+TITLE: Exercise 2.1 Solution
#+AUTHOR: Lucian Augusto

* What is the problem with this version of the TicketMachine's constructor After identifying the issue, test this version on the /naive-ticket-machine/ project. Does this version compile? Create a project and then inspects its fields. Do you notice anything wrong about the /price/ field's value on this version's inspector tool? Can you explain why does this happen??

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public TicketMachine(int ticketCost) {
    int price = ticketCost;
    balance = 0;
    total = 0;
}
#+END_SRC

The constructor presented, has a variable named *price* declared inside its
code block and this variable receives the value passed through the *ticketCost*
parameter. For this reason, the class' own price field is not receiving any
value. Therefore, when inspecting the object using the IDE's inspecting tool,
its price field, instead of having the constructor's *ticketCost* value, has
a value of $0$. Figures [[fig:e21Const]] and [[fig:e21Inspector]] illustrate this.
